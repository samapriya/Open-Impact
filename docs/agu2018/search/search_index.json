Planet Explorer Planet Explorer is probably one of the most useful and beloved interface to interact with and download Planet Labs satellite imagery. Not only does it allow you to filter your images to specific sensors but it also allows you to filter by cloud cover among other things. A neat little trick in Planet Explorer is that once the images are filtered if you want to download multiple images at once in an order you can hold down the control key(if using a windows machine) and click on multiple sets of imagery adding them to the same order. Steps to get satellite imagery from Planet Explorer Once the images have been ordered sit back and relax as the order notification that your delivery is ready to be picked up will be emailed to you. To interact with the Data API and batch download imagery there is host of Planet Platform documentation that teach you how to do that step by step. Batch Download Images Using Planet Python CLI This is the default command line tool that is provided by planet and you can find the project here and it connects to Data API to perform multiple operations such as quick search, activate and download assets among a few other things. Install it easily using pip install planet follow it by planet init to initialize and you are ready to go. A simple setup to download images using a geometry(a simple geometry geojson file) and date range (let us say between 2018-07-01 to 2018-08-31), cloud cover(less than 10% or less than 0.1) could be achieved in a single line of cli command planet data download --item-type PSScene4Band --geom full path to geometry.geojson --date acquired gt 2018-07-01 --date acquired lt 2018-08-31 --range cloud_cover lt 0.1 --asset-type analytic --dest your local directory path Batch Download and Upload to Earth Engine I have also created another stand alone tool apart from the ppipe tool to just download imagery once you have selected area of interest and sensor type. This will work if you have the (Planet Python Client installed). Incase you missed this in housekeeping you can read it again . It is using the Saved search function to allow you to batch download. You can find the tool here . You can pip install it using pip install ppipe This tool is a quick addon to existing application of planet saved searches to download images. This prints all the saved searches that you might have saved using the CLI or using the explorer. In which case you are able to set the filters, choose item types and date ranges and aoi within the Planet Explorer GUI and then be able to use the saved search name to execute a batch download command. This combines activation and download and works only for a single item type that was set in the search.

So here are going to do some housekeeping and setup depending on which tools and setup you are most comfortable with 1) Python Setup and libraries Depending on what type of usage you are interested and the libraries you want to use you can find Python installations here . And here are some of the libraries you can use with that including but not limited to GDAL, Scipy , Numpy , Matplotlib , Pandas , Fiona and Shapely . This list is not exhaustive and include anything else you might need like scikit or learn opencv All of Pypi is your oyster for most systems you can copy and paste this if you have pip on your native command line or terminal pip install numpy scipy fiona shapely matplotlib pandas For Ubuntu and Debian users this might work better and I borrowed it from the installation page at Scipy sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib python-pandas Note that GDAL involves a few additional steps for installation on windows machines You can read more about it here Two other tools or setups which might be handy include virtualenv virtualenv allows the user to create and manage seperate package installations fo multiple projects. Think of this as your new project can have its own set of user libraries seperated from the native python libraries. It allows you to create isolated environments for projects and install packages into that virtual isolated environments. A simple installation would be pip install virtualenv You can get more details about installation on different operation systems and activation of this environment by reading their docs . jupyter notebook The jupyter hub defined jupyter notebook as The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. A lot of the tool chains and processes have been already built into jupyter notebooks for you to use, 2) Planet and Google Earth Engine(GEE) Command Line Interface(CLI) Setup You planet account comes with a brand new CLI and it allows you to perfrom basic functions such as search for ID[s] and for images in a specific location, export all image footprint in your area of interest and so on. Installation is pretty simple pip install planet You installation steps from earlier means you have managed to not only create the Google Earth Engine account but also installed its client. Incase you have missed it go to their main reference page for installation of their python client. Since you can consume Earth Engine using both Javascript(in browser) and Python(locally). 3) Location to GEE datasets For the purpose of this workshop, I have downloaded and ingested Planet imagery into three distinct colllections (PlanetScope 4 Band analytic, Planet 4 analytic surface analytic, RapidEye OrthoTile) If the data is maintained as open access license, you can add any of the datasets by simply adding the following lines. For now you access these here var planetscope4b_toar = ee . ImageCollection ( users/io-work-1/open-ca/PS4BTOAR ) var planetscope4b_sr = ee .

In the GEE environment image collections have their own characteristic setup and are composted with single images that we discussed earlier. They can often have the same or different band structure but generally share a similar metadata structure for filtering and querying. Large scale image collections such as Landsat and Sentinel image collections are ingested on the fly and are actively maintained till there imagery and processing pipelines feeds are maintained byt he agencies supplying the imagery. Images as well as image collections can be moved into GEE environment to allow you to use both your data and the GEE catalog data within the same platform. For those who are concerned with access to datasets, this means that though Earth Engine allows an easier way to share datasets across users, private folder, collections and imagery are private and are not here the section from their Terms and Conditions page Intellectual Property Rights.

These image collection as well as individual imaegs again have defined data type,scales and projections along with some default properties such as an index and ID among other system properties. So we can query these properties, print them and add them var filtered = ee .
