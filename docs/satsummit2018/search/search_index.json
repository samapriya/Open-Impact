Not only does it allow you to filter your images to specific sensors but it also allows you to filter by cloud cover among other things. A neat little trick in Planet Explorer is that once the images are filtered if you want to download multiple images at once in an order you can hold down the control key(if using a windows machine) and click on multiple sets of imagery adding them to the same order. Steps to get satellite imagery from Planet Explorer Once the images have been ordered sit back and relax as the order notification that your delivery is ready to be picked up will be emailed to you. To interact with the Data API and batch download imagery there is host of Planet Platform documentation that teach you how to do that step by step.

And here are some of the libraries you can use with that including but not limited to GDAL, Scipy , Numpy , Matplotlib , Pandas , Fiona and Shapely . This list is not exhaustive and include anything else you might need like scikit or learn opencv All of Pypi is your oyster for most systems you can copy and paste this if you have pip on your native command line or terminal pip install numpy scipy fiona shapely matplotlib pandas For Ubuntu and Debian users this might work better and I borrowed it from the installation page at Scipy sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib python-pandas Note that GDAL involves a few additional steps for installation on windows machines You can read more about it here Two other tools or setups which might be handy include virtualenv virtualenv allows the user to create and manage seperate package installations fo multiple projects. Think of this as your new project can have its own set of user libraries seperated from the native python libraries. It allows you to create isolated environments for projects and install packages into that virtual isolated environments. A simple installation would be pip install virtualenv You can get more details about installation on different operation systems and activation of this environment by reading their docs . jupyter notebook The jupyter hub defined jupyter notebook as The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

You can get the notebook here . Here are the steps we'll follow: Define an Area of Interest (AOI) Save our AOI's coordinates to GeoJSON format Create a few search filters Search for imagery using those filters Activate an image for downloading Download an image Requirements Python 2.7 or 3+ requests A Planet API Key Define an Area of Interest An Area of Interest (or AOI ) is how we define the geographic \"window\" out of which we want to get data. For the Data API, this could be a simple bounding box with four corners, or a more complex shape, as long as the definition is in GeoJSON format. For this example, let's just use a simple box. To make it easy, I'll use geojson.io to quickly draw a shape generate GeoJSON output for our box: We only need the \"geometry\" object for our Data API request: # Stockton, CA bounding box (created via geojson.io) geojson_geometry = { type : Polygon , coordinates : [ [ [ - 121.59290313720705 , 37.93444993515032 ], [ - 121.27017974853516 , 37.93444993515032 ], [ - 121.27017974853516 , 38.065932950547484 ], [ - 121.59290313720705 , 38.065932950547484 ], [ - 121.59290313720705 , 37.93444993515032 ] ] ] } Create Filters Now let's set up some filters to further constrain our Data API search: # get images that overlap with our AOI geometry_filter = { type : GeometryFilter , field_name : geometry , config : geojson_geometry } # get images acquired within a date range date_range_filter = { type : DateRangeFilter , field_name : acquired , config : { gte : 2016-08-31T00:00:00.000Z , lte : 2016-09-01T00:00:00.000Z } } # only get images which have 50% cloud coverage cloud_cover_filter = { type : RangeFilter , field_name : cloud_cover , config : { lte : 0.2 } } # combine our geo, date, cloud filters combined_filter = { type : AndFilter , config : [ geometry_filter , date_range_filter , cloud_cover_filter ] } Searching: Items and Assets Planet's products are categorized as items and assets : an item is a single picture taken by a satellite at a certain time. Items have multiple asset types including the image in different formats, along with supporting metadata files. For this demonstration, let's get a satellite image that is best suited for analytic applications; i.e., a 4-band image with spectral data for Red, Green, Blue and Near-infrared values. To get the image we want, we will specify an item type of PSScene4Band , and asset type analytic . You can learn more about item asset types in Planet's Data API here . Now let's search for all the items that match our filters: import os import json import requests from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth from planet.api.auth import find_api_key # API Key stored as an env variable PLANET_API_KEY = find_api_key () item_type = PSScene4Band # API request object search_request = { interval : day , item_types : [ item_type ], filter : combined_filter } # fire off the POST request search_result = \\ requests . post ( https://api.planet.com/data/v1/quick-search , auth = HTTPBasicAuth ( PLANET_API_KEY , ), json = search_request ) print ( json . dumps ( search_result . json (), indent = 1 )) Our search returns metadata for all of the images within our AOI that match our date range and cloud coverage filters. It looks like there are multiple images here; let's extract a list of just those image IDs: # extract image IDs only image_ids = [ feature [ id ] for feature in search_result . json ()[ features ]] print ( image_ids ) [u 20160831_143848_0c79 , u 20160831_212703_0c43 , u 20160831_212705_0c43 , u 20160831_212706_0c43 , u 20160831_212707_0c43 , u 20160831_212704_0c43 , u 20160831_212703_1_0c43 , u 20160831_180302_0e26 , u 20160831_180303_0e26 , u 20160831_180301_0e26 , u 20160831_143847_0c79 , u 20160831_143846_0c79 , u 20160831_143845_0c79 , u 20160831_143843_1_0c79 , u 20160831_180236_0e0e , u 20160831_180235_0e0e , u 20160831_180234_0e0e ] Since we just want a single image, and this is only a demonstration, for our purposes here we can arbitrarily select the first image in that list. Let's do that, and get the asset list available for that image: # For demo purposes, just grab the first image ID id0 = image_ids [ 0 ] id0_url = https://api.planet.com/data/v1/item-types/{}/items/{}/assets . format ( item_type , id0 ) # Returns JSON metadata for assets in this ID.

In order to download an asset, we first have to activate it. Remember, earlier we decided we wanted a color-corrected image best suited for analytic applications. We can check the status of the analytic asset we want to download like so: # This is inactive if the analytic asset has not yet been activated; otherwise active print ( result . json ()[ analytic ][ status ]) active Let's now go ahead and activate that asset for download: # Parse out useful links links = result . json ()[ u analytic ][ _links ] self_link = links [ _self ] activation_link = links [ activate ] # Request activation of the analytic asset: activate_result = \\ requests . get ( activation_link , auth = HTTPBasicAuth ( PLANET_API_KEY , ) ) At this point, we wait for the activation status for the asset we are requesting to change from inactive to active . We can monitor this by polling the \"status\" of the asset: activation_status_result = \\ requests . get ( self_link , auth = HTTPBasicAuth ( PLANET_API_KEY , ) ) print ( activation_status_result . json ()[ status ]) active Once the asset has finished activating (status is \"active\"), we can download it. Note: the download link on an active asset is temporary # Image can be downloaded by making a GET with your Planet API key, from here: download_link = activation_status_result . json ()[ location ] print ( download_link ) https://api.planet.com/data/v1/download?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJzQXRzTGVHRmFKWGtFYm0wcXJQY3FDaWZ4ZXRsRmtaK2pYZlRoNTJKNzlFVzF5UE1LRWxrUTB0NG5tNTM0U1Nhb1JYSnVvV1dIRzAvSlZieThvU205Zz09IiwiaXRlbV90eXBlX2lkIjoiUFNTY2VuZTRCYW5kIiwidG9rZW5fdHlwZSI6InR5cGVkLWl0ZW0iLCJleHAiOjE1Mzc0NTM4NzgsIml0ZW1faWQiOiIyMDE2MDgzMV8xNDM4NDhfMGM3OSIsImFzc2V0X3R5cGUiOiJhbmFseXRpYyJ9.pmHVEPJKibFAj_PqbCvuavPSnRT-MYZMP0Z5X6YTJ1f5sSv-idN9pEPby7Izn8_nqr_8L0dSLSR4UBfqG3z5HA","title":"Search and Download Quickstart"},{"location":"projects/search_and_download_quickstart/#getting-started-with-the-data-api","text":"Let's search download some imagery of farmland near Stockton, CA.
